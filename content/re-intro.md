Summary: Welcome to the new ryangladstone.com!

Afer a 12 year hiatus, I'm back to blogging. While this blog never amounted to much, I've authored a number of blogs over the years for my small business, my photojournalism, and general news commentary. 

Thankfully, most of that is lost to the sands of time.

I'd like to try something a bit different this time.

Inspired by all-of-the-above [super bloggers like Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/), this blog will be a mix of original analysis, interesting pass-alongs, and even industry job postings that catch my eye.

I'll focus on topics at the intersection of news, engineering, product management, and AI. 

These topics inform my work as the Director of Product Engineering for the Creator Apps at Arc XP, within The Washington Post, but are also just plain interesting to me. 

You can find me on [Twitter](https://x.com/ryangladstone) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryangladstone/), where I'm always happy to talk shop and trade tips.
