Summary: New startup aims to close the coding skills gap


If you live in St. Louis and are interested in getting into Web development or computer programming but not sure where to start, check out [Launch Code](https://www.launchcode.org/). This innovative program, started by [Square](https://squareup.com/) co-founder Jim McKelvey, helps aspiring developers get the experience they need to start working professionally.

Starting tonight, LaunchCode is offering a group class for [Harvard's CS50x](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x). This massive open online course (MOOC) is available year-around online, but Launchcode is providing a chance to work through the program together, with experienced developers on hand to help.
