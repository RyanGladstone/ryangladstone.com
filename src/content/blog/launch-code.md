If you live in St. Louis and are interested in getting into Web development or software development but not sure where to start, check out [Launch Code](https://www.launchcode.org/). This innovative program, started by [Square](https://squareup.com/) co-founder Jim McKelvey, helps aspiring developers get the experience they need to start working professionally.

Starting tonight, LaunchCode is offering a group class for [Harvard's CS50x](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x). This massive open online course (MOOC) is available year-around online, but Launchcode is providing a chance to work through the program together, with experienced developers on hand to help.
