*This is part of my series sharing [interesting media tech job openings](/blog/why-job-postings).*

There are a lot of jobs for AI Engineers out there, you might have heard. 

But not many have the opportunity to positively impact how people in the Great State of Texas stay informed or the chance to work for the stellar [Darla Cameron](https://www.linkedin.com/in/darlacameron/).

This job has both, and more: The chance to have a real, _positive_ impact using AI, and join the team that sets the standard for state-wide newsrooms. 

Looking forward to seeing what compelling new experiences this [AI Product Engineer](https://www.texastribune.org/jobs/ai-product-engineer/) cooks up at the Texas Tribune!
