I plan to share interesting media tech jobs here. 

Some from my team or former colleagues, but not limited to those.

This isn't typical blog content, I know, but I want this site to be more than my Big Thoughts essays. It should be a hub for those of us lucky enough to get to build news products and tools for a living.

At work, I founded our #industry-news Slack channel, which is a clearinghouse for customer updates, competitor releases, and industry intel. I've built a robust RSS setup, tuned my Google Alerts, and created a few custom scrapers to feed it.

One input is job postings, which offer unique insights into a company's strategy. Close reading reveals their outlook and tech stack in ways you won't find elsewhere.

As a byproduct, I now have a steady stream of intriguing postings to share with you!

I hope you find your next role among these gigs!
