&lt;p&gt;Like any card-carrying member of the &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/wait-but-why/generation-y-unhappy_b_3930620.html"&gt;much-maligned Millennials&lt;/a&gt;, I spend just about every waking minute glued to (at least) one screen or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every second spent waiting for a meeting to begin or stuck in line at the grocery store is a chance to respond to emails or catch up on the news (OK, check if my latest self-indulgent Instagram photo has any new likes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Web developer who spends most of my free time studying programming or editing wedding photos at my side gig, I spend enough time in front a screen each day to make even the most steely optometrist weep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, sometimes I just need some time away to think. I can't imagine my life without the Internet, but I can't imagine much of anything if I don't get some time offline each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's where my bike commute comes in handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While biking and electronics are not mutually exclusive — I could buy one of those iPhone holder racks for my handlebars or listen to music with my Yurbuds — I have so far resisted the temptation to make my ride as Internet-tethered as the rest of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m certainly not the first person to realize that time away from your desk can yield some of the best problem-solving. There’s something about the brain’s operation that has a way of resolving problems in a unique fashion when it is given time to linger off topic. It is far above my pay grade to explain how or why; I’m just happy to have the chance to recharge on the way home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, next time my coworkers wonder why I’m not at my desk — tell ’em I’m out thinking.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"/></entry></feed>
